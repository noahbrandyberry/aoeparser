You can import data from buildorderguide.com by navigating to the webapp, opening the inspector, and going to the network tab. From there, view only XHR request, reload the page and download the largest request (it's ~15mb of data so it will take a bit). Rename the downloaded file to input and place it in the root of this repo.
